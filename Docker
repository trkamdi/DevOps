Docker -
1. Virtualization - is use to create multiple server on top of our physical server

2. Container- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
Cycle how container come - physical server--> virtual server-->Containers
