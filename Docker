Docker -
1. Virtualization - is use to create multiple server on top of our physical server

2. Container- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
Cycle how container come - physical server--> virtual server-->Containers
- Virtual machine is more secure than conatiners because it has full OS with full i
solation where as Containers don't have full OS and they do not there full os.

Containers- it is a package or collection of application, application libraries and system dependencies.
3. Why Contanrisation-


-difference between container and (VM)instance?
Ans- 1.container  consume minimum disk space where as VM consume large disk space.
2.which allow container to boot up faster and Vm not.
3.container has less isolation as it shares more resources and VM has complete isolation, vm dont underly on common OS.
-what, why advantages of conatiner.
-install docker on instance.

Docker Images?
-how to write Docker Image.
-difference between CMD and RUN.
=RUN sets up the image, while CMD defines what happens when you run a container from that image!


----------------------
08-08-24
Commands-
-docker ps -a
-docker run -it centos bash
-cat /etc/*release* - version of the application
-docker run -d(detach mode) ubuntu sleep 20
-docker rm 345 xoe 34e  = container id is this and will deleted at a time.
-docker inspect Contaiener ID
-docker run -p 80:8000 tejascloud/webapp -porting command

Advanced Command:

-Difference between Docker run and Docker Pull
Ans- docker pull -Useful when you want to download an image without creating a container.
-docker run= Creates and starts a new container, pulling the image if needed- docker run -d --name mycontainer nginx.
